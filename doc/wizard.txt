Configuration Creation Wizard
=============================

// Configure the Interface to use
1. user must choose between TCP, UART, I2C
2. dependent on chosen Interface user has to provide the needed parameters
3. Testing if connection to client is possible.
  if no -> show error then go back to 1
  if yes -> read client informations
// temperature sensors
4. read temperatures from all temperature sensors that the client supports
5. assemble list with temperatures. And interface names. Select all reasonable/valid temperatures.
6. User needs to change selection as needed.
  Selected sensors will be used. Not selected sensors will be ignored(not connected or broken)
// heaters
7. show list of all heaters with connection names. Ask users to select all used or unknown heaters.
8. with all selected heaters do:
 a) read and store all temperature sensors temperatures.
 b) switch the heater on to full heating for 10 seconds
 c) read all temperatures again.
 d) present list of temp. sensors and interface names and cur. Temp. to user.
  Select the temp. sensor with highest temperature increase. Ask user to acknowledge that this is the correct temp. sensor far the heater.
 e) ask User which component has been heated. Move temperature to 60 degree centigrade. This way user can determine by touching without burning.
 f) if client supports: do an PID auto tune on the heater with the selected sensor.
// Stepper motors
9. Ask user to move all axis in a middle position(so that movement in both directions is possible)
10. ask user to remove all plastic or modify extruder stepper in a way that the motor can move. Alternatively heat all extruder to a temperature that allows extrusion.
11. show list of steppers with interface names to user and ask state for each motor which axis it drives. Allow unknown.
12. if user knows start with these stepper else with all steppers:
 a) move stepper in increasing direction.
 b) ask user what axis has moved - if unsure go back to a)
 c) ask user in which direction the motor moved.  - if unsure go back to a)

 if is is either X, Y or Z then:

 d) ask user if end switch at min and max are available.
 e) let user trigger the min end switch
 f) let user trigger the max end switch
 g) move to min position ( end switch triggered)
 h) ask user to mark the position of the nozzle.
 i) move nozzle in increasing direction either triggered by user or till end stop. Count steps.
 j) ask user for distance of current nozzle position to marked position (steps moved/distance = steps per mm)

 if the stepper handles a extruder then:

 d) tell user to insert plastic
 e) tell user to mark the plastic 10 cm from where it disappears into the extruder.
 e) heat extruder up
 f) do some steps
 f) ask user to measure distance between extruder and marking in plastic (steps/distance = steps per mm)

 13. Show a list of all Fan connectors to the user. Put the connection names next to each connection.
 give the user the option to enable/disable each fan and then let him decide which fan is connected to what( Extruder fan, Nozzle fan, ...)


At the end or whenever the user cancels the procedure he gets asked if he wants to store the configuration. If yes ask for filename and store configuration then exit.
